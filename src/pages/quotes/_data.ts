    text: `When you get what you want in your struggle for self,  
And the world makes you king for a day,  
Then go to the mirror and look at yourself,  
And see what that man has to say.  

For it is not a man's father, mother or wife,  
Whose judgment upon him must pass,  
The fellow whose verdict counts most in life  
is the one staring back from the glass.  

He's the fellow to please, nevermind all the rest,  
For he's with you clear to the end  
And you've passed your most dangerous, difficult test,  
If the man in the glass is your friend.  

You can fool the whole world down the pathway of years,  
And get pats on the back as you pass,  
But the final reward will be heartache and tears,  
If you've cheated the man in the glass.

If you feel overwhelmed, breathe. It will calm you and release the tensions.

If you are worried about something coming up, or caught up in something that already happened, breathe. It will bring you back to the present.

If you are moving too fast, breathe. It will remind you to slow down, and enjoy life more.

Breathe, and enjoy each moment of this life. They’re too fleeting and few to waste.

This way, we can end the dominion of that role in our lives. We both free it from an existence it actually hates and offer ourselves an opportunity for growth! The biggest obstacle in abandoning the role, that is, the lower personality, is not knowing the existence of a higher level - the fear that if the role goes away, we will fall into a void.",
