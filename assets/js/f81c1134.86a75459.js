But, surprisingly, it let me in! I vaguely remember trying a few other variations, like changing the case of a character in the middle of the password, and they worked too. At the time, I thought it was some bug or glitch and forgot about it.\\n\\nToday, while binge-reading [Michael Lynch\'s blog](https://mtlynch.io/posts/) and link-hopping, I came across [this](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13426544) HN post about mistyped passwords and how Facebook handles them:\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n\\n![Our reply: Hi Christopher, We accept four forms of the user\'s password to help overcome the most common reasons that authentic logins are rejected. In addition to the original password. we also accept the password if a user inadvertently has caps lock enabled, if their mobile device automatically capitalizes the first character of the password, or if an extra character is added to the end of the password. We feel this does not significantly impact the security of the user\'s password or their account.
