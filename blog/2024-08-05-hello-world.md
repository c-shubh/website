Hello World!

I built my previous site using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [MUI](https://mui.com/). The other day I set up a [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site for a friend. I have been planning to write and publish content on my website for a long time now, but never got around to do it. To reduce friction I decided to move to a platform where I don't have to worry about implementing all the basic blog functionality from scratch. After some research, I decided on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Spent an evening setting it up and achieving feature parity with my previous site, making sure to not break any URLs. Lo and behold, my new site.
